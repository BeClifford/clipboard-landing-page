## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
Having gotten access to my desing files, I read importants text embedded in the README.txt file to understand what was required of me in the challenge.

I noted them down and followed the instruction I was give, i.e screen sizes, colors, font size.

I then analyzed the design to acertain how I could stucture and group information provided me, it using Html. From there I worked on the Css classes, variables and utilitie, after which I coded the entire site with Html and styled it using CSS.

Note: Some of the decisions I made was entirely from me because I was given much details to work with.

Finallly, I went through the site to make sure everything was working perfectly and then created the README file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learnt alot from this challenge, from critical analysis of the design to how to structure it. A critical lesson I gained is why its important to define your :roots, classes as well as utilities to make the process easy and unrepetitive.

```html
<section class="wrapper">
        <div class="headline-box">
          <h1> A history of everything you copy</h1>
          <p>Clipboard allows you to track and <br>organize
          everything you copy. Instantly <br>access your clipboard on all your devices.</p>
</section>
```
```css
:root {
    /* Base */
    --clr-primary-500: hsl(171, 66%, 44%);
    --clr-secondary-100: hsl(233, 100%, 69%);
}
```

### Continued development

Here are some areas I focus on and strive improving in the near future:
// HTML //
- Html structuring
- Classes naming

// CSS //
- Defining classes and utilities well to avoid incosistency and     redundancy
- Responsiveness (Flexbox- *flex*) and (Grid).
- Fluid Typography.
